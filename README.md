# Microservice-A
Kolton's media service


### Media Microservice for Band Hub App 

This microservice handles media uploads (photos and videos) for bands. Band members can upload media with metadata (e.g., date taken, band name), retrieve and filter it, and perform basic CRUD operations. Built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
